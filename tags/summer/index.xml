      <description>Texas is known for 2 things - the bbq üçó and Texas summer heat üò¨. Temperatures reach 100F pretty regularly, in fact the first year when I moved to Austin we had 100 days of 100F weather. On the plus side the waters in the pool, lake is nice and warm and thats how Texans usually beat the summer ‚ùÑÔ∏è
Its not unusual for kids day cares to have multiple splash pad days during the week and my kids were dying to enter the public pools.</description>
