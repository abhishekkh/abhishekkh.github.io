      <description>Learning Go has always been on my todo list for a few years. It has been gaining in popularity recently and is one of the top languages developers want to learn in 2020. Or maybe the Go song inspired me ðŸ˜†
  I started with the Tour of GO to learn the basic syntax and data structures. Its a great learning resource with a few exercises thrown in. My main motive was to learn about Concurrency in GO, which is where GO seems to score with developers.</description>
