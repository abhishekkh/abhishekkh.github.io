      <description>Texas is known for 2 things - the bbq üçó and Texas summer heat üò¨. Temperatures reach 100F pretty regularly, in fact the first year when I moved to Austin we had 100 days of 100F weather. On the plus side the waters in the pool, lake is nice and warm and thats how Texans usually beat the summer ‚ùÑÔ∏è
Its not unusual for kids day cares to have multiple splash pad days during the week and my kids were dying to enter the public pools.</description>

      <description>I have always wanted to write a blog but never actually found the time or energy to do this. It feels great to finally be able to carve out some time and publish my view on different topics I care about. Again these are just my opinions and not meant to harm anyone.
I came to the United States as a student pursuing my Masters üéì in August 2006. I can&amp;rsquo;t believe that it&amp;rsquo;s been 14 years now.</description>
